# Fwiffo's Starsector Version Checker

This is a simple application to check updates for the game Starsector. It does essentially the same thing as the game's Version Checker mod (which I highly recommend), but without the need to actually launch the game.

## How to use

1) Without using config.txt - drop the folder with the app into Starsector's core folder (for instance D:\Starsector\SS_VC\) and launch from there.
2) Using config.txt - replace the placeholder text in config.txt file with the path to your Starsector core folder (for instance D:\Starsector) and launch from anywhere.
